Our inspiration is <span style="font-weight: 300">10 Albums</span>, a work by conceptual artist Ilya Kabakov.</blockquote>',

        'description' => '<p>Ilya Kabakov was born in 1933 in the Soviet Union. His early works explore such issues as the combination of words and images and the relationship between the object and its meaning. Kabakov has also developed a special interest in the seemingly ordinary and banal.</p>
    <p>In the 1970s he created a series of Albums (1972-5). Each album has as its subject an extremely sui generis character. These unbound books symbolically recount - through texts and drawings – the fictional story of a group of artists who live on the fringes of society and whose work is not valued or recognized. The images symbolize the vision of each character-artist. Many have as subtitles comments made by his friends and relatives. The final image in each album is a blank page that announces the character&rsquo;s death and each of them ends with some general comments on the whole of his wok, made by fictional commentators that suppose to represent the educated class, who are after all the ones that document and manage the &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; of the artist.</p>
    <p>The personal visions of the central characters of these albums, to a great extent, refer to the history of the avant-garde movements of the twentieth century. Moreover, the comments of intruders indicate the different levels of misinterpretation and misunderstanding that any work of art inevitably is exposed to. These albums, nevertheless, are uniquely poetic, full of passion and executed with impressive precision and care.</p>
    <p>This is the way Kabakov chose to balance the lack of a real audience for his artistic creation, however this imaginary audience as presented in the albums show no deeper understanding of art. Their interpretations can multiply infinitely and the meaning of the work is lost in this eternal process. Strangely this boosts the artist optimism rather than making him feel pessimistic. The artist seeks the spectator&rsquo;s attention, though not his interpretative control. Kabakov by incorporating into the work the comments that this may generate enables it to attract the spectator&rsquo;s attention without being left to its mercy.</p>
    <p>In the albums Kabakov dealt with this mixture of hope and fear while awaiting the new viewer, the future &ldquo;environment&rdquo;, the acceptance by a stranger. This anticipation creates hope: &ldquo;the next perspective viewer may understand the work better than his contemporaries&rdquo;… He may bring the artist the attention, love and admiration his immediate environment does not offer. Along with hope there is fear that this new viewer probably does not understand the work and considers it unnecessary, and only of possible sentimental value to the artist and his immediate circle.</p>
    <p>Kabakov&rsquo;s works operate simultaneously on multiple levels: they mislead our emotions while at the same time torment our intelligence, entertain us, control us and enchant us. Our performance works on all these levels by inviting the audience to actively be a witness, sometimes as the protagonist, sometimes as an accomplice or as a commentator of the theatrical act and sometimes as a mere spectator, something that the artist himself seeks to achieve through his work.</p>
    <p>Additionally we have used some of Tim Burton\'s poems (The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories) as lyrics for musical interludes.</p>',

<p>As the little girl in our story says.</p>
<p>We went up and down the stairs more than once. Reacting  to two short stories by Haruki Murakami, we listened to physicists, psychologists and poets talking about time and coincidences. But we mostly talked with friends, relatives, colleagues and with each other. We entered more personal territories, we were surprised by what we remembered and remembered what surprised us. We stumbled across the spoonerisms and blunders that we would love to forget, the moments when we accidentally or miraculously received a gift or got a fright.</p>
<p>We came to the conclusion that people are thirsty for gifts and frights. Thirsty for stories that do not have a linear development, stories which do not necessarily explain everything and stories that leave a “question mark” lingering on...</p>
<p>Likewise, we do not take a final stance. Having faith in our instinct, we are not afraid of contradictions. We lay heterogeneous things side by side and we let ourselves trust the body, the image and the rhythm. In the end, we may find something that looks like an elephant or an umbrella. But, when we find it, we will feel certain that this  is what we have been looking for, all along.</p>',

        'description' => ' <p>The performance <strong>Is everything I have ever forgotten as big as a house?</strong> is a barrage of questions that refer to the human condition. They are questions that we all inevitably ask ourselves at some point in our lives. They are "major" and "minor" questions, of a philosophical nature or not. They are questions that talk about love, fear, loneliness, the need to belong, the thirst for power, and about how people exploit each other.</p>
    <p>We draw our inspiration from an installation by Peter Fischli and David Weiss entitled "Questions". Then, quite naturally, other texts on the same topic came our way. Thus, we met John Cage, Ben Vautier and Forced Entertainment and we felt that we all have something in common: the need to ask questions and seek answers:</p>
    <p>► Is happiness looking for me in the wrong place?<br>
      ► Shall I move to another city and rent a house under a false name?<br>
      ► Shall I remove the exhaust pipe and drive around the neighborhood at night?<br>
      ► Is my body a hotel?<br>
      ► Are my lies a masterpiece of the avant-garde?</p>
    <p>During the rehearsals we welcomed everything that was personal or hidden away. There were questions that made us laugh and others that made us cry. We posed questions that no one was able to answer and questions that concealed something other than the obvious. We watched the questions sing and dance, fall and rise. We shut each other\'s mouth when it came to questions that we could not stand to hear. We sat in silence and in the dark trying to retrieve those questions that spring up from nowhere just before we fall asleep. We let these questions tell their stories with music and humor.</p>',

        'description' => '<p>Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing gained a reputation in the late 1960&rsquo;s for his radical objection to conventional psychiatry. His early books <strong>The Divided Self</strong> and <strong>The Politics of Experience</strong> questioned the right of society to proclaim itself sane and others mad.</p>
    <p>Protesting the &ldquo;outrageous violence&rdquo; inflicted on patients by drastic therapies like electric shock, he generated controversy with his willingness to try psychedelic drugs, meditation, and other unconventional techniques in search of a healing common ground between doctor and patient.</p>
    <p>Apart from his purely scientific books Laing wrote three others, which belong to the field of literature. <strong>Do You Love Me?</strong> and <strong>Knots</strong> are a &ldquo;conversation in dialogue and verse&rdquo; (to quote Laing himself). They are a sequence of dialogues and poems that vividly depict the &ldquo;knots&rdquo; and impasses of human relationships.</p>
    <p><strong>The Facts of Life</strong> consists of diaries, memoirs, and thoughts, which reveal Laing&rsquo;s conviction that disturbed personalities, are sane people who react irrationally to an environment of emotional instability, frigidity, and violence. Besides, Laing himself was an assaulted and battered, by his parents, child and that surely constitutes an omen for his later focusing on the interpersonal and social environ that people grow in.</p>
    <p>Our show is based on these three books and constitutes an attempt to work our way into the wounded soul of a boy who is suffocating in his attempt to understand the absurd games his parents play. Games he inevitably resorts to, himself because he does not know any other way of &ldquo;being&rdquo; in a relationship.</p>

    <p><strong>This be the verse</strong><br>

    <p>They fuck you up, your mum and dad.<br>
      They may not mean to, but they do.<br>
      They fill you with the faults they had<br>
      And add some extra, just for you.</p>
    <p>But they were fucked up in their turn<br>
      by fools in old-style hats and coats,<br>
      who half the time were soppy-stern<br>
      and half at one another\'s throats.</p>
    <p>Man hands on misery to man.<br>
      It deepens like a coastal shelf.<br>
      Get out as early as you can,<br>

    'about_noiti' => ' <p>Over the last few years we have been actively engaged in producing devised and performance pieces, trying to develop our own individual method – a method which mainly aims at creating images rather than words. We have been moving away from traditional theatre, maintaining that the clear distinction between the audience and the actor hinders the growth of the feeling that we all belong to a community and we are all troubled by the same worries. <p>
 <p>We do not wish to keep the spectator in the dark, we do not expect him to totally forget himself and immerse in the world of fiction. We do not want the spectator to lose sense of time and place. On stage, the actor plays a role, or multiple ones, without losing his identity. At the same time, the spectator, through his emotional participation, remains fully conscious of his being actively in communion with the event.</p>',

<p>Its first production was the double-bill <strong>Her big chance</strong> by <em>Alan Bennett</em> and <strong>A sermon</strong> by <em>David Mamet</em> (<strong>Technohoros Ypo Skian</strong>, May 1999). </p>
<p>It was followed by <strong>Do you love me?</strong> which was based on the life and work of the famous psychiatrist <em>R. D. Laing</em> (<strong>National Theatre of Greece</strong>, Experimental Stage, June 2001, & <strong>FOURNOS</strong> Theatre, October - December 2001). </p>
<p>In 2003 <span class="noitigrammi">NOITI GRAMMI</span> staged <strong>Kvetch</strong> by Steven Berkoff and in 2004 <strong>The Bird of Pleasure</strong>, a performance based on Peter&rsquo;s Carey short story, <em>Exotic Pleasures</em>. </p>

<p>In 2008-9<span class="noitigrammi"> NOITI GRAMMI</span> created another devised piece, <strong>Never take the stairs</strong>, exploring the flighty topic of coincidences. </p>

<p>In 2014 <span class="noitigrammi">NOITI GRAMMI</span> and the <strong>Fundamental Monodrama Festival</strong>  co-produced  the Luxembourg premi&egrave;re of  <strong>I remember</strong>, a performance/installation inspired by <em>Joe Brainard</em>\'s book on his memories of growing up.
